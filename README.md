📈 Stock Price Predictor

Stock Price Predictor is a web-based application that leverages deep learning to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. Built with a clean and interactive interface using Streamlit, this project allows users to select a stock, view historical trends, and predict future prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.

🔧 Features :

📊 Real-time visualization of historical stock price data.

🔍 Stock selection interface powered by Yahoo Finance API.

🤖 Future price prediction using an LSTM-based deep learning model.

🧠 Model trained on closing prices with time series forecasting.

💾 Data storage using SQLite for caching and persistence.

🖥️ Intuitive UI built with Streamlit for easy interaction and live feedback.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: Streamlit

Backend/ML: Python, TensorFlow, LSTM

Database: SQLite

API: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)
